## Making AI Make Sense

A framework for deploying AI where it's strong and routing around where it's weak. These pieces build on each other.

**[Start here: Making AI Make Sense](/writing/making-ai-make-sense/)** — The complete framework in one page.

Or explore the components:

| Essay | What it covers |
|-------|----------------|
| [Knowledge as Capability](/writing/knowledge-as-capability/) | The foundational claim: knowledge is capability to produce outcomes |
| [Agent-Relative Tacitness](/writing/agent-relative-tacitness/) | Why tacitness depends on who's doing the knowing |
| [Tacit Space Shrinkage](/writing/tacit-space-shrinkage/) | How AI is making the inexpressible expressible |
| [AI as Oracle vs. Assistant](/writing/ai-oracle-vs-assistant/) | The fundamental choice: ask for answers or ask for execution |
| [The Strong Oracle Trap](/writing/strong-oracle-trap/) | Why sophisticated dialogue doesn't solve the verification problem |
| [Executable Knowledge Architecture](/writing/executable-knowledge-architecture/) | The pattern for AI-augmented professional work |
| [Capability Governance](/writing/capability-governance/) | The governance framework: stakeholder obligations for generated artifacts |
| [Agentic AI as Universal Interface](/writing/agentic-ai-universal-interface/) | How the pattern scales: AI removes barriers to direct system access |
| [The Universal Interface Thesis](/writing/universal-interface-thesis/) | Beyond knowledge work: the pattern applies to any control surface |
| [Automating Expertise Gets Easier and Easier](/writing/automating-expertise-gets-easier/) | What faces pressure and what remains as more expertise becomes software |
| [Ontology Generation](/writing/ontology-generation/) | How organizational knowledge accumulates from universal interface logs |
| [What Benchmarks Aren't Measuring](/writing/what-benchmarks-arent-measuring/) | Why current AI benchmarks test the wrong things for professional work |
| [AI-First Software](/writing/ai-first-software/) | The design philosophy: AI as foundation, not feature |
| [The Return of the Assistant](/writing/return-of-the-assistant/) | The DIY knowledge worker made sense. AI offers something better. |
| [Update for February 2026](/writing/update-february-2026/) | Two years of advances tested the framework. The distinction holds—but agentic AI creates new gaps. |
| [Answers to Critics](/writing/answers-to-critics/) | Direct responses to adversarial critique: what's refined, what's defended, what's unchanged. |

## Updates and Responses

The framework has been tested against critique and technological change. These essays document the evolution.

| Essay | What it covers |
|-------|----------------|
| [Update for February 2026](/writing/update-february-2026/) | Research validating the oracle/assistant distinction against 2024-2026 advances; the agentic erosion problem |
| [Answers to Critics](/writing/answers-to-critics/) | Direct engagement with adversarial review: refinements, precision improvements, and defended positions |
