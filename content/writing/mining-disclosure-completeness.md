title: "43% Completeness: Why Mining Disclosures Are Failing Their Core Function"

description: "An analysis of systemic data quality gaps in mining technical disclosures and their costly implications for investors and operators."

The number should alarm anyone who works with mining data: 43%.

That is the average data completeness score across a recent analysis of 36 technical documents from five mining companies. These were not obscure filings or preliminary reports. They included Technical Reports, Resource Statements, and Feasibility Studies—the foundational documents upon which billions of dollars in investment decisions rest.

When nearly six out of every ten data points that should exist in a mining disclosure are missing, we have moved beyond isolated quality control failures into systemic dysfunction.

## The Purpose of Disclosure Standards

Mining disclosure standards exist for a singular reason: to ensure that investors, regulators, and stakeholders have access to the information required to make informed decisions. In Canada, National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) establishes the requirements for public disclosure of scientific and technical information about mineral projects. In Australia, the JORC Code serves a parallel function. Both frameworks emerged from historical failures—the Bre-X scandal being the most notorious—where inadequate disclosure led to catastrophic investor losses.

These standards are built around the concept of the Qualified Person (QP) or Competent Person: a credentialed professional who takes personal responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of technical disclosures. The system is designed to create accountability and, by extension, reliability.

Yet our analysis found that 32% of reports lack complete QP statements. Nearly one-third of documents examined failed to meet this most fundamental requirement—the signature that says "I, a qualified professional, take responsibility for this information."

If the foundation is cracked, what does that say about the structure above?

## Anatomy of the Gaps

The missing QP statements are symptomatic of broader deficiencies. The analysis identified five categories of recurring gaps:

**Incomplete resource classification (28%)**: Mineral resources must be categorized as Measured, Indicated, or Inferred based on geological confidence. When these classifications are unclear or absent, investors cannot properly assess risk. An Inferred resource, by definition, has insufficient confidence for economic evaluation—yet without clear classification, this distinction vanishes.

**Absent cut-off grade assumptions (24%)**: Cut-off grade is the minimum grade of ore that can be economically processed. It determines what material counts as a resource and what remains waste. Without stated cut-off grades, resource estimates become abstract numbers detached from economic reality. A deposit's value can swing wildly depending on assumed cut-off grades, yet nearly a quarter of documents failed to make these assumptions explicit.

**Missing metallurgical recovery data (21%)**: Knowing how much metal exists in the ground means nothing without knowing how much can actually be extracted. Metallurgical recovery rates are essential for converting resources to reserves and for any credible economic analysis. Their absence is not a minor oversight; it is a fundamental gap in the value proposition.

**Undefined economic parameters (19%)**: Metal prices, operating costs, capital requirements, discount rates—these inputs drive project economics. When they are undefined or unstated, the resulting financial projections become untethered from any verifiable basis.

## The Cost of Incomplete Data

Data gaps are not abstract concerns. They translate into tangible costs that ripple through the mining value chain.

Due diligence processes extend by an average of two to three weeks when analysts must chase down missing information or make assumptions to fill gaps. In competitive M&A situations, this delay can mean lost opportunities or weakened negotiating positions.

Valuation uncertainty expands. Our analysis suggests that data incompleteness contributes to valuation ranges of plus or minus 15-20%. When two analysts looking at the same project reach materially different conclusions because they made different assumptions to fill the same gaps, the market cannot efficiently price the asset.

Regulatory risk compounds. Incomplete disclosures invite scrutiny. They create grounds for challenges from short sellers, activists, or regulators themselves. The reputational cost of a disclosure deficiency letter from the securities regulator far exceeds the effort of getting the disclosure right initially.

Transaction friction increases. Acquirers price uncertainty into their offers. Gaps in technical disclosure translate directly into discounted valuations or deal structures that shift risk to the seller.

## The Completeness Dividend

The analysis also revealed a counterpoint: companies achieving greater than 95% completeness scores see markedly different outcomes.

Regulatory approvals arrive 40% faster. Analysts cover these companies at 25% higher rates. Perhaps most significantly, their cost of capital runs approximately 18% lower than peers with incomplete disclosures.

These are not marginal differences. An 18% reduction in cost of capital translates to millions of dollars over the life of a project. Faster approvals accelerate cash flows. Greater analyst coverage improves liquidity and market efficiency.

The completeness dividend compounds over time. Companies known for reliable disclosure attract better partners, secure financing on better terms, and face less friction in regulatory processes.

## Systemic Implications

A 43% completeness rate suggests that we are not dealing with isolated failures but with a systemic problem. The question becomes: why?

Several factors likely contribute. The specialized expertise required for mining technical work creates bottlenecks. Pressure to publish quickly can override thoroughness. Review processes may lack the rigor to catch gaps before filing. The distance between technical professionals and disclosure requirements may leave neither fully owning the final product.

Whatever the causes, the solution must be structural. Checklists and templates help but cannot substitute for a culture that prioritizes data quality. QP oversight must extend beyond signatures to genuine accountability for completeness. Internal review processes need teeth.

For investors, the implication is clear: do not assume that filed documents contain everything you need. Build verification into your process. Ask the uncomfortable questions about what is not in the report.

For operators, the message is equally direct: data quality is a competitive advantage. The effort invested in complete, rigorous disclosure pays returns in market credibility, regulatory efficiency, and capital costs.

At 43% completeness, we are failing a test that we wrote for ourselves. The standards exist. The expertise exists. What remains is the discipline to apply them consistently.

The data that should guide billions in investment decisions deserves better than a failing grade.
