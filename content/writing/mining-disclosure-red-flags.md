title: "Five Non-Negotiables: What Separates Bankable Mining Projects from Empty Promises"

description: "A practical guide to identifying critical disclosure failures that should stop any mining investment conversation before it starts."

In my years of reviewing mining projects across multiple commodities and jurisdictions, I have developed an almost instinctive response to certain disclosure patterns. Not because I am looking for reasons to dismiss projects, but because experience has taught me that some omissions are not oversights. They are warnings.

The five red flags outlined here are not minor technical quibbles. They represent fundamental failures in project disclosure that should give any investor, analyst, or potential partner serious pause. When you encounter these issues, you are not looking at a project that needs polish. You are looking at a project that may not exist as represented.

## The Qualified Person: Your First Line of Defense

Every resource estimate, technical report, or material scientific disclosure under NI 43-101 requires a Qualified Person signature. This is not bureaucratic box-checking. The QP system exists because someone with appropriate credentials must stake their professional reputation on the claims being made.

When a company presents resource figures without identifying the Qualified Person by name and professional certificate number, you are looking at a disclosure that may not be legally compliant. More importantly, you are looking at claims that no credentialed professional has been willing to endorse.

The question is simple: Who signed off on this? If the answer is vague or unavailable, the conversation should end there.

## The Drill Hole Database: Where Reality Lives

"Based on 250 drill holes" sounds impressive until you ask the obvious follow-up: Where are they?

A legitimate resource estimate comes with collar coordinates, downhole survey data, and assay tables. This is not optional information. It is the foundation upon which the entire resource model is built. Without it, there is no way to verify that those 250 holes exist, that they intersect the zones claimed, or that the assay values reported are accurate.

When companies present headline numbers without the underlying drill data, they are asking you to accept claims on faith. In mining investment, faith is expensive. Demand the data. If it cannot be produced, assume it does not exist.

## Cut-Off Grade: The Number That Changes Everything

A resource statement that reads "50Mt at 1.2% Cu" tells you very little without knowing the cut-off grade. This is the threshold below which material is considered waste rather than ore. It determines what gets counted in the resource and what gets excluded.

Without a stated cut-off grade and the net smelter return calculation behind it, you have no way to assess whether the resource is economically meaningful. I have seen resources shrink by forty percent or more when a proper cut-off is applied. That impressive tonnage figure may include vast quantities of material that will never see the inside of a mill.

Always ask: What are the assumptions? What metal prices, recovery rates, and operating costs were used to derive the cut-off? If these questions produce discomfort rather than data, take note.

## Sensitivity Analysis: Understanding the Downside

A project economics summary that presents a single NPV figure with no sensitivity analysis is a warning sign. Commodity prices fluctuate. Operating costs can exceed estimates. Recovery rates may underperform lab results. Any credible economic assessment must address these realities.

When a company provides a single-point valuation without showing how that number changes as key inputs vary, they are either hiding unfavorable sensitivities or have not performed the analysis. Neither explanation inspires confidence.

The question is straightforward: What is the downside? A project that only looks attractive at prices well above current spot, or that becomes uneconomic with modest cost increases, is a project with significant unacknowledged risk.

## The Replication Test: Can You Verify the Claims?

Legitimate technical work is reproducible. When a company provides full methodology, complete datasets, and transparent assumptions, an independent analyst can review the work and reach similar conclusions. This is not about distrust. It is about verification.

When you encounter resistance to providing complete information, when methodologies are described as proprietary, when data is available only in summary form, you should ask why. Sometimes the answer is legitimate. Often, it is not.

The final question is always: Can I replicate this? If the answer is no, you are not evaluating a project. You are evaluating a promise.

## Conclusion: Your Due Diligence Starts Here

These five elements—qualified person attestation, drill hole data, stated cut-off grades, sensitivity analysis, and reproducible methodology—are not advanced technical requirements. They are baseline expectations for any project seeking serious capital.

When companies cannot or will not meet these standards, they are telling you something important. Perhaps they lack the technical sophistication to present their project properly. Perhaps they are hiding weaknesses they hope you will not notice. Perhaps the project does not exist as described.

In any of these cases, the appropriate response is the same: step back.

Your capital deserves projects that can withstand scrutiny. The mining industry is full of legitimate opportunities led by professionals who welcome due diligence rather than avoiding it. Your role as an investor or analyst is to find those projects and allocate capital accordingly.

When a company cannot answer basic questions about their technical work, the problem is not your due diligence process. The problem is the project.
