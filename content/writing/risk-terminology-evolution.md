title: "What 18,000 Mining Reports Reveal About Risk Disclosure"
date: 2025-08-17
description: "A 20-year analysis of how risk language in technical reports has evolved—and what the numbers actually mean."
---

I analyzed 18,778 mining technical reports spanning 2005-2024 to understand how risk disclosure has evolved. The headline finding was striking: risk terminology increased from 11.3% of documents to 87.8%. A transformation.

Then I looked closer.

---

## The Initial Finding

Using full-text analysis of NI 43-101, JORC, and SK-1300 reports from the Prospector Portal database, I tracked how often technical reports included risk language—terms like "operational risk," "environmental risk," "climate risk," co-occurring with "risk," "hazard," or "uncertainty."

The growth was dramatic:

| Period | Documents with Risk Language |
|--------|------------------------------|
| 2005-2008 | 11.3% |
| 2010-2011 | 40.4% |
| 2014-2015 | 70.3% |
| 2018-2019 | 81.3% |
| 2024 | 87.8% |

New risk categories emerged. ESG risk went from 0% to 30.5%. Climate risk increased 13-fold. Financial risk grew 10x. The mining industry, it seemed, had fundamentally transformed its approach to risk communication.

---

## The Complication

Then I ran categorical overlap analysis.

60% of reports mentioning environmental risks also mention climate risks—typically describing the same underlying issues. ESG risk shows similar overlap. What looked like expanded risk identification was partially terminology proliferation: the same risks described with multiple labels.

The revised picture:

- **Apparent improvement**: 26 percentage points
- **Real improvement**: ~15 percentage points of unique risk identification
- **Overlap inflation**: ~10 percentage points from relabeling

Reports with lower overall risk terminology presence actually showed *less* overlap—suggesting more focused risk identification. Quantity of risk terms doesn't correlate with quality of risk assessment.

---

## What The Data Actually Shows

### Quality vs. Quantity Disconnect

Quantitative presence (what I initially measured):
- 91.9% of 2024 reports contain risk terminology
- 75.4% have explicit Item 25 risk sections
- Multiple risk categories per report increasing

Qualitative reality (what overlap analysis reveals):
- Only 10-30% include causal explanations
- 0% provide clear risk category definitions
- Same risks appear under 2-3 different labels
- 76% of companies show no terminology change 2020-2024

### The Stratification Pattern

| Report Type | Risk Term Presence | Overlap Level |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Economic Studies | 100% | Low |
| Resource Estimates | 93% | Medium |
| Property Reports | 75% | High |

Reports with *lower* risk terminology presence had *less* overlap. More focused risk identification, not less.

---

## The Methodological Lesson

Simple presence/absence metrics overstate improvements. Category proliferation doesn't equal better risk assessment. More labels don't mean more insight.

The dramatic statistical improvements I initially identified are partially illusory—driven by terminology proliferation rather than enhanced risk assessment quality.

Better metrics for future studies:
- Percentage with unique, non-overlapping risks identified
- Percentage with causal risk explanations
- Percentage with quantified risk assessments
- Average risk description quality score

---

## What This Means

For mining companies: Focus on identifying unique, material risks. Avoid redundant categorization. Provide causal explanations, not just risk lists.

For regulators: High terminology presence masks quality issues. Consider requiring risk definitions and evaluating unique risk identification.

For investors: Much of the increase is relabeling, not new risk identification. Look for causal explanations and unique risks, not category counts.

---

## The Real Story

Risk disclosure in mining has genuinely improved. Awareness is higher. Regulatory expectations are clearer. The industry takes risk communication more seriously than it did two decades ago.

But the transformation is more modest than the numbers suggest. The true improvement is about 15 percentage points of genuine risk identification—not the 26 percentage points that a naive analysis would show.

This is what happens when you look past the surface metrics. The story gets more nuanced, but also more accurate.
