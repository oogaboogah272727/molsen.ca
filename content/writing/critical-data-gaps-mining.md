title: "The $500M Problem: Missing Data That Makes Mining Projects Unfinanceable"

Every mining project tells a story through its technical reports. But increasingly, the most important chapters are missing.

After reviewing dozens of feasibility studies and NI 43-101 reports from major producers over the past year, a troubling pattern emerges: material omissions that make rigorous financial analysis impossible. These are not formatting oversights or minor disclosure gaps. These are fundamental data points without which no rational investor can build a defensible valuation model.

The consequence? Valuation uncertainty ranging from 20% to 40%—enough to transform a project from financeable to stranded with a single spreadsheet revision.

## Three Case Studies in Missing Data

Consider Barrick Gold's Pascua-Lama project on the Chile-Argentina border. The technical documentation lacks metallurgical recovery rates for oxide ore and provides no updated capital cost estimate reflecting post-pandemic inflation. Without recovery rates, revenue projections become educated guesses. Without current capital estimates, NPV calculations carry uncertainty exceeding plus or minus 40%. For a project of this magnitude, that uncertainty translates to billions of dollars in potential value—or potential loss.

First Quantum's Cobre Panama tells a similar story. The project documentation omits cut-off grade sensitivity analysis and provides no assumptions for converting inferred resources to higher confidence categories. With approximately 30% of the resource base sitting in the inferred category, investors face a fundamental question: what is the economic basis for including these tonnes in any valuation? The answer, based on available disclosure, is unclear.

Perhaps most concerning is Newmont's Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru. The technical reports lack characterization of acid generation potential in the tailings facility and provide no detailed closure cost estimates. Based on analogous operations in similar geological and regulatory environments, closure liabilities could exceed $500 million. That is not a rounding error—it is a potential impairment event hiding in plain sight.

## The Anatomy of Unfinanceability

These gaps fall into predictable categories, each with distinct implications for project economics:

**Revenue uncertainty** stems from missing metallurgical data. Recovery rates vary significantly by ore type, and without this granularity, any revenue projection is speculation dressed up in decimal places. A project claiming 90% recovery that achieves 82% has fundamentally different economics—often the difference between viable and uneconomic at prevailing metal prices.

**Margin uncertainty** arises from incomplete operating cost disclosure. When technical reports present single-point estimates without methodology, breakdown by cost center, or sensitivity to key inputs like energy and labor, due diligence teams cannot stress-test the numbers. This is particularly problematic in an inflationary environment where input costs have diverged significantly from historical assumptions.

**Viability uncertainty** appears when water rights, permitting status, or social license documentation is incomplete or absent. A project can have excellent geology and favorable economics on paper while remaining fundamentally undevelopable due to unresolved community relations or unaddressed regulatory requirements.

**Liability uncertainty** is perhaps the most insidious category. Closure and rehabilitation costs represent legal obligations that persist for decades beyond mine life. When these estimates are missing or obviously understated, investors face asymmetric risk: the upside is already priced in, but the downside remains hidden in footnotes—or absent entirely.

## What Rigorous Disclosure Looks Like

The elements of adequate disclosure are not mysterious. They represent standard practice at well-managed operations and should be baseline expectations for any project seeking institutional capital:

Metallurgical recoveries broken down by ore type, processing route, and confidence level. Operating costs with transparent methodology, component breakdown, and explicit assumptions about key inputs. Capital estimates that include contingency calculations consistent with project stage and that acknowledge post-study inflation. Cut-off grade sensitivities that demonstrate project robustness across commodity price scenarios. Closure provisions based on detailed engineering, not back-of-envelope analogies. And documentation of community engagement, regulatory status, and social license that acknowledges both achievements and outstanding challenges.

This is not an exhaustive list, and specific requirements vary by project type and jurisdiction. But these elements represent the minimum necessary for building a credible financial model.

## The Cost of Opacity

When disclosure falls short, several things happen. Sophisticated investors either pass entirely or demand punitive risk premiums. Project timelines extend as financiers require supplementary studies to fill gaps that should have been addressed in the original documentation. And market valuations become untethered from fundamental analysis, creating volatility that serves no productive purpose.

The aggregate cost of inadequate disclosure across the mining sector is difficult to quantify precisely, but it runs to billions of dollars annually in higher financing costs, delayed development decisions, and misallocated capital.

## A Path Forward

The solution is not more regulation or longer reports. It is a cultural shift toward recognizing that transparency is not a compliance burden but a competitive advantage. Projects with rigorous, complete disclosure attract capital faster, at better terms, and with fewer conditions.

For investors, the implication is clear: skepticism is warranted when key data is absent. The gaps themselves are information—about management priorities, technical capacity, and willingness to engage honestly with project risks.

For project developers, the message is equally direct: you cannot expect investors to value what they cannot model. Complete disclosure is not about satisfying auditors; it is about demonstrating that you understand your own project well enough to develop it successfully.

The $500 million problem is real, and it is hiding in filing cabinets across the industry. The question is whether we continue to accept it—or demand better.
