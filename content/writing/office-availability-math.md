The claim in [The Return of the Assistant](/writing/return-of-the-assistant/) is that two people working the same 9-5 schedule in the same office are only available to each other about 80% of the time. That's the generous number. The real availability for synchronous handoff is much lower.

## Annual Overlap: Days Both Present

Start with a standard work year:

- **Working days**: ~260 per year (52 weeks × 5 days)
- **Holidays**: ~10 days (both absent, so no impact on overlap)
- **Sick days**: ~5 days each per year
- **Vacation**: ~10-15 days each per year

If Person A takes 5 sick days and Person B takes 5 sick days, and these don't overlap, that's 10 days where one is absent. Similarly for vacation—call it 20 days of non-overlapping absence between the two.

**Result**: ~230 days where both are present out of ~250 working days (after holidays). That's **~92% annual overlap** on days present.

The 80% figure in the main essay is actually conservative for this factor alone.

## Daily Overlap: Hours Both Available

Here's where the math gets worse. Being in the same building isn't the same as being available to each other.

A typical 8-hour workday:

| Activity | Person A | Person B | Overlap Lost |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Lunch | 12-1pm | 12:30-1:30pm | 1 hour |
| Meetings | 2 hours | 2 hours | 2-3 hours (different meetings) |
| Focus time | 1 hour | 1 hour | 1-2 hours (don't interrupt) |
| Breaks/coffee | 30 min | 30 min | 30 min |
| Bathroom/errands | 20 min | 20 min | 20 min |

Even if both people are "at work," their available windows don't align. Person A is free 10-11am; Person B is in a meeting. Person B is free 2-3pm; Person A is heads-down on a deadline.

**Conservative estimate**: Of an 8-hour day, perhaps 4-5 hours have any potential for overlap. But the windows shift independently, so actual aligned availability might be **3-4 hours**—roughly **40-50% of the workday**.

## Combined Availability

Multiply the factors:

- Annual overlap (days both present): ~90%
- Daily overlap (hours both available): ~45%
- **Combined**: ~40% of nominal work time

Two people with the same schedule, in the same office, working on the same projects, are actually available to each other less than half the time.

## The Coordination Tax

This explains why the coordination overhead described in [The Return of the Assistant](/writing/return-of-the-assistant/) was multiplicative:

1. **The secretary's queue**: Other people's tasks competed with yours
2. **Your own queue**: Your own tasks competed with each other for secretary time
3. **Your availability**: You couldn't hand off work while in meetings or away
4. **The secretary's availability**: They couldn't receive work while in meetings or away

Each factor compounds. If you're available 45% of the time and the secretary is available 45% of the time, the overlap where you can actually hand off work is roughly 20% of the workday.

The DIY productivity revolution was liberating because it eliminated this coordination tax entirely. Word processing, spreadsheets, and email didn't just save money on secretarial salaries. You could work on your schedule, at your pace, without waiting for availability windows to align.

The AI assistant preserves this freedom—you can delegate to it any time, with no coordination overhead—while restoring the division of labor that made the secretary model efficient in the first place.
