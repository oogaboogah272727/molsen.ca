The claim in [The Return of the Assistant](/writing/return-of-the-assistant/) is that two people working the same 9-5 schedule in the same office are only available to each other about 80% of the time. That's the generous number. The real availability for synchronous handoff is much lower.

## Annual Overlap: Days Both Present

Start with a standard work year:

- **Working days**: ~260 per year (52 weeks × 5 days)
- **Holidays**: ~10 days (both absent, so no impact on overlap)
- **Sick days**: ~5 days each per year
- **Vacation**: ~10-15 days each per year

If Person A takes 5 sick days and Person B takes 5 sick days, and these don't overlap, that's 10 days where one is absent. Similarly for vacation—call it 20 days of non-overlapping absence between the two.

**Result**: ~230 days where both are present out of ~250 working days (after holidays). That's **~92% annual overlap** on days present.

The 80% figure in the main essay is actually conservative for this factor alone.

## Daily Overlap: Hours Both Available

Here's where the math gets worse. Being in the same building isn't the same as being available to each other.

A typical 8-hour workday:

| Activity | Person A | Person B | Overlap Lost |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Lunch | 12-1pm | 12:30-1:30pm | 1 hour |
| Meetings | 2 hours | 2 hours | 2-3 hours (different meetings) |
| Focus time | 1 hour | 1 hour | 1-2 hours (don't interrupt) |
| Breaks/coffee | 30 min | 30 min | 30 min |
| Bathroom/errands | 20 min | 20 min | 20 min |

Even if both people are "at work," their available windows don't align. Person A is free 10-11am; Person B is in a meeting. Person B is free 2-3pm; Person A is heads-down on a deadline.

**Conservative estimate**: Of an 8-hour day, perhaps 4-5 hours have any potential for overlap. But the windows shift independently, so actual aligned availability might be **3-4 hours**—roughly **40-50% of the workday**.

## Combined Availability

Multiply the factors:

- Annual overlap (days both present): ~90%
- Daily overlap (hours both available): ~45%
- **Combined**: ~40% of nominal work time

Two people with the same schedule, in the same office, working on the same projects, are actually available to each other less than half the time.
