I lead AI strategy and adoption at [SRK Consulting](https://srk.com), a global mining industry technical consultancy. I have spent years in professional services figuring out how to make organizations actually work—the systems, the support functions, the leadership problems nobody writes case studies about.

Now I think about what happens when AI meets professional accountability. The questions:

- When you can't fully explain how you arrived at a recommendation, can you still defend it?
- What does it mean to be an expert when expertise can be encoded?
- How do organizations govern work they can't fully inspect?

This site collects my attempts to answer them. The framework is evolving. I'm probably wrong about some of it. I try to be honest about which parts.

I'm based in Canada. My leadership philosophy owes more to Captain Phule and Duke Leto than to Harvard Business Review, which tells you something.
