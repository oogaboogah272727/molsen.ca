I lead AI strategy and adoption at <a href="https://srk.com" target="_blank">SRK Consulting</a>, a global mining industry technical consultancy. <a href="https://www.srk.com/en/consultants/mike-olsen" target="_blank">My profile</a>. I have spent years in professional services figuring out how to make organizations actually work — the systems, the support functions, the leadership problems nobody writes case studies about.

Now I think about what happens when AI meets professional accountability. The questions:

- When you can't fully explain how you arrived at a recommendation, can you still defend it?
- What does it mean to be an expert when expertise can be encoded?
- How do organizations govern work they can't fully inspect?

This site collects my attempts to answer them. The framework is evolving. I'm probably wrong about some of it. I try to be honest about which parts.

I'm based in Canada.
