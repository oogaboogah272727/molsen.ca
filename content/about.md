I'm a technical leader working at the intersection of AI, professional services, and industrial operations.

Currently, I lead AI strategy and adoption at [SRK Consulting](https://srk.com), a global engineering consultancy.

I think about what happens when AI meets professional accountability. The questions that interest me:

- When you can't fully explain how you arrived at a recommendation, can you still defend it?
- What does it mean to be an expert when expertise can be encoded?
- How do organizations govern work they can't fully inspect?

This site collects my writing on these topics. The papers are more formal; the essays are thinking out loud.

I'm based in Canada.
