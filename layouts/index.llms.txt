## About This Site

Mike Olsen writes about AI governance, professional accountability, and the future of technical work. The core contribution is a framework for deploying AI in professional contexts: maximizing AI strengths while routing around its weaknesses.

## The Framework

The "Making AI Make Sense" framework addresses a central problem: AI is powerful but unreliable. Most approaches either ignore the unreliability and get burned, or avoid AI entirely and miss the value.

The framework's core move: ask AI to execute instructions, not provide answers. This shifts verification from checking answers (which requires expertise to produce them) to checking methods (which requires only expertise to understand them).

Key concepts:
- **Oracle vs Assistant modes**: Asking for answers vs asking for execution
- **Executable Knowledge Architecture (EKA)**: Expert specifies intent, AI translates to executable artifact, human verifies
- **Knowledge as capability**: Defining knowledge operationally as capability to produce outcomes
- **Agent-relative tacitness**: Tacitness as a property of transfer relationships, not intrinsic to knowledge
- **Tacit space shrinkage**: AI capabilities opening transfer paths that didn't exist before
